                            can still charge during cloudy days, though at a

                            minimal sunlight. For optimal performance, place
                            your solar lights in areas that receive maximum
                            direct sunlight during the day.

                        <p>
                            Yes, we offer extended warranty options for most of
                            our premium products. You can purchase an additional
                            1-year or 2-year warranty extension at the time of
                            your purchase. Extended warranties provide the same
                            coverage as our standard warranty for the additional
                            period. Contact our customer service for more
                            information about extended warranty options and
                            pricing.
